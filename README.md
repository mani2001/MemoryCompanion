# MemoryCompanion - A tool to help people remember things
MemoryCompanion is a tool for people suffering with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a condition in which users face memory or thinking related problems but not to the point that it affects their daily activities. These people tend to miss social events, forget appointments and have issues with remembering names or conversations with other people. MemoryCompanion helps these people keep track of conversations, names, tasks to do and much more!

## Features

1) Add - In this mode the user is able to store information that he feels is important to his life. For example "Chris told me he is getting married on 24th November 2024".
2) Query - In this mode the user can talk with an interactive llm to know things like - "Do I have anything important on 24th november?" Answer - "Chris is getting married on 24th Nov"
   
   Another example is:
   - Add - "John told me to work on my programming skills to improve efficiency and that he will visit me later"
   - Query - "What did John tell me, I don't remember properly"
   - Answer - "John told you work on your programming skills"

## Future scope
- Adding speech to text and text to speech for blind or elderly users who find it hard to use the web interface.
- Add options to delete information from the database (for now, once it is stored you cannot remove it through the interface)
- Better website with simpler components

## Considerations
- The chroma vectorstore used has a limit and a lot of data cannot be stored so user may need to delete the database.txt file or reduce it from time to time (which can be improved with persistent storage and so on)
- Need to first choose 'Add' or 'Question' mode to send inputs
